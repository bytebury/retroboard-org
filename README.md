## About

Retroboard was born out of wanting an opinionated way to run retrospectives. There are many tools today that exist; however, they all require you to sign-in, limit your boards, or want you to pay.

Retroboard.org is different. You don't need an account to create a Retroboard, just enter a name, press go, and share the link with your team. We also are _opinionated_. We think that's a good thing. We give you three columns, What Went Well, What Didn't Go Well, and Action Items. We believe that this will help with decision fatigue. You won't have to worry about changing how you run retro, just follow the pattern so you can focus on these three items.

Retroboard.org is also anonymous. There's no sign-in, so you can feel safe by saying things the team might need to hear &mdash; but keep it professional.
